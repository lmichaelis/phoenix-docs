# ZenGin Documentation
This project contains documentation for file formats used by *ZenGin*, a game engine developed by 
[Piranha Bytes](https://www.piranha-bytes.com/) for the games [Gothic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_(video_game)) 
and [Gothic II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_II).

## Building the documentation
This documentation can be built by first installing the dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`) and then
running `mkdocs build`. The built documentation files can then be found in the `site/` directory.

Alternatively, a development server can be started by running `mkdocs serve`. Opening the link displayed in the console
in a browser will cause it to automatically reload when any changes are made to the documentation files.
